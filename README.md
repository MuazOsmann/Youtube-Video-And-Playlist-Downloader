# Youtube-Downloader

I made a simple video downloader using Python, and with the help of the Pytube library

to make the program work you need to install the required libraries, just run the `install.bat` file.

The Program supports both a Single video download and downloading a whole playlist download at once.

You can execute the python file by opening a CMD and typing `py Downloader.py` OR by executing the file `run.bat`
